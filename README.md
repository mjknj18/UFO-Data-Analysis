# UFO-Data-Analysis

The goal of this project was to use JavaScript to present a filterable HTML table of UFO sightings data from January 2010 within a web page. D3 was used to generate and format the table, as well as apply the filters.

## Questions

1. Create and display a HTML table of all UFO sightings on web page initialization.
2. Allow users to filter the UFO sightings table by date, city, state, country, and/or state.
