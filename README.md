# UFO-Data-Analysis

The goal of this project was to use JavaScript to present a filterable HTML table of UFO sightings data from January 2010 within a web page. Since the baseline data was provided in the form of a JSON array, D3 was used to generate and format the table, as well as apply the filters.

## Questions

1. Create and display a HTML table of all UFO sightings on web page initialization.
2. Allow users to filter the UFO sightings table by date, city, state, country, and/or shape.

## Datasets

1. https://github.com/mjknj18/UFO-Data-Analysis/blob/master/static/js/data.js

## Tasks

1. Import the UFO sightings data from JSON array.
2. Create a function to generate a table from the full JSON array or a filtered version.
3. Add filter fields to the HTML web page for date, city, state, country, and shape.
4. Create a function to filter the table data when the user clicks a button to apply filters.
